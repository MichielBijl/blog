Earlier this year I discovered a website called [CodePen](http://CodePen.io). They describe themselves as follows:

> CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor in your browser with instant previews.

But that is not all, it is also a place where great minds come together to build amazing stuff together, it is a platform to learn front-end related techniques and languages, it is a place to see what incredible stuff other people create, it is a place to try out different approaches to an issue, a place you can grow your knowledge.

Over the last couple of months I've spend a fair amount of time on this great website, and have even become a Pro member to support CodePen and its founders Chris, Alex and Tim. In my time there I have learned a lot about all sorts of different parts of the web, met some great people, and hopefully inspired others to create beautiful pieces of code themselves.

This post serves as a thank you to CodePen and its community, thank you.
