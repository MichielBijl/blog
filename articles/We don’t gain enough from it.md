# On understanding your craft
Ever since I got interested in web development at the age of twelve, I have cared about the use of correct HTML elements. At that point I wasn’t familiar with the world of accessibility; it just seemed like the logical thing to do. And I like logical things; they are easy to understand! You can document logical things. Other can read that documentation and go “Hey, this makes sense!” And if it’s not logical to them, then it either needs a better explanation, or the thing isn’t logical.

## Is HTML logical?
Yes, no, both! Some stuff is really logical. Headings and paragraphs for example, make a lot of sense. Headings form the outline of your document and paragraphs add content. It doesn’t get more basic than headings and paragraphs. Yet headings are often misused by developers and content editors alike for the way they are styled (be it by user agent styles or a custom CSS file).

HTML was (primarily) designed to be used for scientific papers. Yay science! These sort of papers—like a school paper, or a blog post—have clear outlines. You start with the title of the thing, for example: “What do dinosaurs mean with rawr?”. For the sake of readability and ease of referencing your document, sub-sections are labelled and added, e.g.: “Introduction”, “Sound analysis”, “Conclusion”, and “Bibliography”. 

Due to the research team’ excellent work we have _a lot_ of content for our sound analysis section. It would be best if we devided that section of the paper even further. After we’ve done that, the document outline might look something like:

* What do dinosaurs mean when they say rawr?
	* Introduction
	* Sound analysis
		* Analyses of skulls
		* Comparison with birds
		* Different dialects within the community
	* Conclusion
	* Bibliography
