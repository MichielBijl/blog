After a [tweet by Steven Sawczyn](https://twitter.com/steveofmaine/status/685552540235071489) I got curious as to how certain apps fair when used with VoiceOver on iOS. The document lists some apps I have loaded on my phone and how I—a visual VoiceOver user—experience them.

## Results

* iMessage compose window: works very well
* Telegram compose window: has a lot of unlabelled buttons
* Spotify: playlists and now playing window work very well (haven't tested other windows)
