# CSUN 2016
This year marks my first time at [CSUN in San Diego](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2016/sessions/index.php/public/website_pages/view/1). It’s also my first time in the United State of America. Better yet, it is the first time I travel outside Europe! More importantly though, it will give me the chance to learn a whole lot, meet lots of new people and finally shake hands with—or give hugs to—people I have been talking to for quite a while as part of my work for the W3C. So you better watch out if you’re in the ARIA Working Group ;)

## Agenda
Because there is _so much_ to do at CSUN, it will be hard to see everything and do everything that interesets me. To keep me from losing my mind, I’ve compiled a list with all the workshops and talks I would like to attend.
