## Vertical rhythm

I'd like to establish a vertical rhythm on the website. This is something that makes everything easier on the eyes. It's been a while since I've built something like this, so any tips are welcome. For now, I'm going with 32 pixels as my base rhythm. `vertical.html` contains a test for these values.

* Base text size: 1.25rem (20px)
* Base line-height: 1.6em (32px)
* Base margin top: 1.6em (32px)
* Large text size: 1.875rem (30px)
* Large line-height: 1.6em (48px / 2.4rem)
* Large margin top: 1.6em (48px / 2.4rem)
