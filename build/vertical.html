  <h2>All the lives lost during the war</h2>
  <p>Neue Grafik, the publication, was designed with a strong sense of hierarchy. For that reason, I was compelled to use it as the driving force of this design. The title, subtitle, and recent posts (which fade in and out) perfectly took the place where of the original title. The posts automatically divide into three columns to sync with the original design. I wanted to integrate images and videos seamlessly, which are placed into the posts are now automatically resized.</p>
  <p>My theme “1967” is based on the Swiss Modernist poster “Juni Festwochen Zurich – 1967” by Josef Müller–Brockmann. Müller–Brockmann’s work has always been an inspiration, so when invited to produce a theme based on a 60’s Swiss poster Müller–Brockmann immediately sprang to mind. The aim of the theme was to replicate the vintage print feel of the poster using HTML &amp; CSS aiming to emphasis the gap between print and screen. The biggest challenge was to reproduce the blue diagonal line, and retain the print overlay feel. This was achieved using the Absolute positioning and z-index CSS property. In keeping with the minimal theme the template is designed to dynamically display the latest 3 posts from wordpress.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The older my eyes get, the harder it is to find surprises.</li>
    <li>But the work of Richard Paul Lohse has been a reminder of the joy that can come from seeking out those surprises.</li>
    <li>The basis for this theme, an advertisement by Lohse for Wohnbedarf, around 1965.</li>
    <li>Despite it’s bare structure, the image has a strong visual impact.</li>
    <li>It strikes me as the perfect foundation for an online experience. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The theme is based on one of Wim Crouwel’s posters for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. While it is not one of his more famous posters I felt it lent itself well to being translated into a usable WordPress theme and I loved the visual impact of the rotated text. The act of deconstructing the design was quite revealing as to the attention to detail that goes into something that looks so simple. The site title is used for the rotated text (generated automatically using javascript and CSS3 transformations). I adapted the design a little for the inner pages to support larger passages of text by moving the title into a single column.</p>
