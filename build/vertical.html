  <p>Neue Grafik, the publication, was designed with a strong sense of hierarchy. For that reason, I was compelled to use it as the driving force of this design. The title, subtitle, and recent posts (which fade in and out) perfectly took the place where of the original title. The posts automatically divide into three columns to sync with the original design. I wanted to integrate images and videos seamlessly, which are placed into the posts are now automatically resized.</p>
  <p>My theme “1967” is based on the Swiss Modernist poster “Juni Festwochen Zurich – 1967” by Josef Müller–Brockmann. Müller–Brockmann’s work has always been an inspiration, so when invited to produce a theme based on a 60’s Swiss poster Müller–Brockmann immediately sprang to mind. The aim of the theme was to replicate the vintage print feel of the poster using HTML &amp; CSS aiming to emphasis the gap between print and screen. The biggest challenge was to reproduce the blue diagonal line, and retain the print overlay feel. This was achieved using the Absolute positioning and z-index CSS property. In keeping with the minimal theme the template is designed to dynamically display the latest 3 posts from wordpress.</p>
